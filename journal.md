Work on this project didn't happen so far since last commit due to multiple reasons. 
+ Getting list of peers is done
+ I guess I have to continue from sending messages to A peer.

Target - upto Handshake.

Worked until getting list of peers.
+ I have to put a limit to what I'll be doing everyday, stick to that and don't get bored of this whole process.

Going to restart this project - this time with NodeJS instead of CPP.
I wanted to make it all bit easier. 
Major goal is not a perfect torrent client, but to learn about involved systems.
A venture to learn JS, nodeJS in depth.
